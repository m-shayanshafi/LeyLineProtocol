This is a tinyos-2.0.2 port of the S4 routing protocol, originally written for
TinyOS-1.x by Lili Qiu, Yun Mao, Feng Wang, Simon Lam and Jonathan Smith.

To run this code in TOSSIM, simply 'cd' into s4-tinyos-2.x/apps/TestS4Simple and
run "./batch_run.sh". That script should compile the code for TOSSIM and run a 
C++-based TOSSIM simulation. The simulation simply routes a packet from node ID
82 to node ID 203 in a 225 node grid. Of course, this is all assuming that you
have TOSROOT etc. set to the right directories of your tinyos-2.0.2 installation.
